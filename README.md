# New Addition
A new R script file has been added showing how to load the ***ChickWeight*** dataset
and how to explore it using ggplot2, mainly using the quickplot (qplot) function. 
The code contains commands for producing twenty distinct ggplot2 visualisations. These are saved in 
the figures subdirectory of the folder. 

## ***Suggested Task***
- View the R script file, available [here] (https://github.com/JonMinton/AQMEN_Data_Vis_Workshop/tree/master/additional_material/chickweight_code_example.r), and for each ggplot command write down your guess about what the visualisation will produce. 
- Compare your guesses to the figures produced, available in the figures subdirectory. How many did you guess correctly?
- Download the R script file, and the associated figures, and reproduce the figures using the script.
